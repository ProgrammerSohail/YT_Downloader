# Change Log - ORION's YouTube Downloader

## Initial State (2025-05-20)
- Project contains a Flask backend (`app.py`) using `pytube` for YouTube downloads.
- Frontend consists of HTML (`templates/index.html`), CSS (`static/css/style.css`), and JavaScript (`static/js/script.js`).
- Frontend is designed to get video info, display quality options, and handle download requests via AJAX calls to the backend.
- Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
- A batch file (`run_downloader.bat`) is provided for setting up a virtual environment and running the application using `pip` for dependency installation.

## Analysis
- The project structure and code appear largely complete.
- The frontend JavaScript is implemented to interact with the backend API.
- The CSS provides styling.
- The backend uses `pytube`, which is a common source of issues due to YouTube updates.
- The `run_downloader.bat` file uses `pip` for dependency installation, which conflicts with the user's instruction to use `bun`. `bun` is not designed for Python dependency management.

## Plan
1.  **Address Dependency Installation:** Clarified with the user that `bun` is for JavaScript/Node.js and cannot install Python packages. User confirmed to stick with `pip`.
2.  **Troubleshoot `pytube` Issues:**
    *   Suggested updating `pytube` to the latest version using `pip`. **Completed.** Upgraded pytube to 15.0.0.
    *   Investigate common `pytube` errors (like the 400 error) and apply known workarounds or patches if necessary. Attempted to search online for fixes but browser tool did not provide search results. Attempted a common fix by adding a more general regex pattern to `venv\Lib\site-packages\pytube\cipher.py`. **Completed.**
    *   Add more detailed logging in `app.py` to help diagnose specific errors during video info fetching or downloading. **Completed.** Added print statements around `YouTube()` object creation and stream fetching/downloading.
3.  **Implement Changes:** Once the plan is approved and the dependency issue is resolved, switch to ACT MODE to implement the troubleshooting steps and any necessary code modifications. **Currently in progress.**
4.  **Testing:** Test the application with various YouTube URLs and download types to confirm functionality. **Attempted.** Testing after applying fixes still results in 500 errors during video info fetching, indicating the `pytube` issue persists.

## Current Status & Next Steps (2025-05-20)
- `pytube` upgraded and logging added to `app.py`.
- Attempted a common regex fix in `pytube\cipher.py`, but the issue persists.
- The 500 errors during video info fetching suggest `pytube` is still failing to interact with YouTube correctly, likely due to ongoing changes in YouTube's player script.
- Without reliable browser access to get the latest YouTube player JavaScript or search for more specific, up-to-date `pytube` workarounds, a definitive code fix is difficult at this time.
- **Recommended Troubleshooting Steps for User:**
    *   Try using a different YouTube video URL in the application to see if the issue is isolated to the previous URL.
    *   Verify internet connection stability and check for any network restrictions (firewalls, proxies, etc.) that might be blocking access to YouTube's servers.
    *   Consider testing `pytube` functionality in a simple, standalone Python script (outside of the Flask app) to determine if the problem is with the `pytube` library itself or how it's being used within the Flask application.
